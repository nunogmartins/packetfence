Documentation
-------------

The in-depth or more technical documentation is always as close to the code 
as possible. Always look at the `POD` doc 
footnote:[Perl's Plain Old Documentation: http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html].
To do so, the prefered way is using the `perldoc` command as follows:

  perldoc conf/authentication/ldap.pm
