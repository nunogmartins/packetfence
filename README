  What is PacketFence?
  --------------------

  PacketFence is a fully supported, trusted, Free and Open Source network 
  access control (NAC) system. Boasting an impressive feature set including a 
  captive-portal for registration and remediation, centralized wired and 
  wireless management, 802.1X support, layer-2 isolation of problematic 
  devices, integration with the Snort IDS and the Nessus vulnerability scanner;
  PacketFence can be used to effectively secure networks - from small to very 
  large heterogeneous networks. 

  You want to know who is on your network?
  You want to give different access to your network based on who is connecting?
  PacketFence is for you!
